# "Timeplan"

Timepan is a one-day project I made with an existing API (also made by me) to tell you when the class starts, how long is left of the class and how long until the class ends. Because of a major change in our schedule at school when we went from having a break after two classes lasting thirty minutes, we now have a fifteen-minute break between each class and only one thirty-minute break. This is quite confusing, as we don't have this on Wednesdays too. So I made a website that I will add to all the classrooms' screens so it's less confusing for both me and everyone else. This change was not discussed at all, but they are "testing it out" for the rest of the year.
